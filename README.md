Project :  Predictive Maintenance of Industrial Machinery

# 🔧 Predictive Maintenance Using Machine Learning (IBM Cloud)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to develop a **predictive maintenance model** for a fleet of industrial machines. By analyzing real-time sensor data, the system predicts the **type of machine failure** (e.g., Tool Wear, Power Failure, Heat Dissipation Failure) before it occurs. The model enables **proactive maintenance**, reduces downtime, and optimizes operational efficiency.

The solution was developed using **Python**, trained on a public dataset, and deployed using **IBM Watson Studio** and **Watson Machine Learning** on **IBM Cloud**.
